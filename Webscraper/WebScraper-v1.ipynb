    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a useful technique to convert unstructured data on the web (such as a table or list) to structured data (such as dataframe) that you can use for a variety of purposes. For example, you might want to scrape an education website to get data on school test scores in order to analyze student performance, or you might want to take voting information by zip code from a government webpage to create a visual image of voting trends in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the questions / problems / products whose solutions might start with web scraping and information extraction (data collection) before you get to data analysis and interpretation. You can probably think of many others!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ways to extract information from web\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to extract information from the web. **APIs** are probably the best way to extract data from a website. Almost all large websites like Twitter, Facebook, Google, Reddit, and StackOverflow provide APIs to access their data (or at least limited sections of their data) in a more structured manner. For example, if you want to get all Tweats using #NASA during a time period, you can get that through their API in a nice format that is pretty easy to use.  So, if you can get the data you want through an API, it is almost always preferred approach over web scraping. This is because if you are getting access to structured data from the provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RSS feeds** are another way that a website can share information for people to use for other purposes. For example, blogs will often produce an RSS feed that you can use to get a copy of all the recent posts, which you can then for your work.  But they are limited in their use and are mostly found in sites that have routine updates (such as news pages, blogs, or podcasts).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what can you do when you want information that is on a website but they don't have an API or RSS feed that meets your purposes? Well, that is when you scrape the website to grab the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is a technique for extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform web scraping in various ways, and using almost any programming language. But Python makes it pretty  easy, as you will learn below, and Python has lots of libraries that can help.  Python also had a large (and growing) number of users who are continually creating new libraries and packages, as well as tutorials for customizing your projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open source programming language and you will often find multiple libraries that can perform the same function. We will use the ‘BeautifulSoup’ library for our lesson below, it is easy and intuitive to work with.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries required for web scraping\n",
    "We will use two libraries in the webscraping project below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**BeautifulSoup**: It is an incredible tool for pulling out information from a webpage. You can use it to extract tables, lists, paragraph and you can also put filters to extract information from web pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup does not however fetch the web page for us. We will also use a library for opening the webpage URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Urllib.request**: It is a Python module which can be used for fetching URLs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several other options for HTML scraping in addition to BeatifulSoup. Here are some others: mechanize, scrapemark, or scrapy.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics – Get familiar with HTML (Tags)\n",
    "While scraping the we, you deal with html tags. Thus, it is quite useful to have good understanding of them.  Below is the basic syntax of HTML.  This syntax has various tags as elaborated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!DOCTYPE html> : HTML documents must start with a type declaration\n",
    "    HTML document is contained between <html> and </html>\n",
    "    The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>\n",
    "    HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags\n",
    "    HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag\n",
    "    Other useful HTML tags are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    HTML links are defined with the <a> tag, “<a href=“http://www.test.com”>This is a link for test.com</a>”\n",
    "    HTML tables are defined with<Table>, row as <tr> and rows are divided into data as <td>\n",
    "    html table\n",
    "    HTML list starts with <ul> (unordered) and <ol> (ordered). Each item of list starts with <li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you are new to this HTML tags, I would also recommend you to refer HTML tutorial from W3schools. This will give you a clear understanding about HTML tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting starting, take a look at the webpage you will be scraping:\n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_and_union_territory_capitals_in_India\" target=\"_blank\">  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_and_union_territory_capitals_in_India</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, now it is time to begin... you will have to import the **BeautifulSoup** library, which is part of the **bs4** package, and import **urllib.request**.  "
