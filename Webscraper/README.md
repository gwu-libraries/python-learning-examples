# Start Here

Launch the interactive version of the Webscraper project using Binder. Binder is a free tool for hosting interactive Jupyter Notebooks and it is a great way for students to get started with learning Python.

After Binder launches, you should see a Jupyter Notebook file for this module.

Depending on demand, Binder can be a bit slow. But it's free!
