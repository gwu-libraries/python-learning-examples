Launch an interactive session with the course's Jupyter notebooks using the free Binder service. Try it!

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gwu-libraries/python-learning-examples/master?filepath=%2FML-titanic%2FML-titanic-v1.ipynb)

After Binder launches, you should see a Jupyter Notebook file for this module.

Please note that Binder is a free service from Project Jupyter. Depending on demand, it can be a bit slow. But it's free!
