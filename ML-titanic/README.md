You can also launch an interactive session with the course's Jupyter notebooks using the free Binder service. Try it!

INSERT LINK - launch in binder

After Binder launches, you should see a Jupyter Notebook file for this module.

Please note that Binder is a free service from Project Jupyter. Depending on demand, it can be a bit slow. But it's free!
