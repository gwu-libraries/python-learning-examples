Launch an interactive session with the course's Jupyter notebooks using the free Binder service. Try it!

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gwu-libraries/python-learning-examples/master?filepath=%2FML-titanic%2FML-titanic-v1.ipynb)

After Binder launches, you should see a Jupyter Notebook file for this module.

Please note that Binder is a free service from Project Jupyter. Depending on demand, it can be a bit slow. But it's free!

# Python Foundations
This use of Juptyer Notebooks is based on Prof. Barba's course [Getting Data Off the Ground with Python](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:GW+EngComp1+2018/about).  And her [introductory modules (especialy 1 thru 3)](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp1_offtheground/tree/master/notebooks_en) are a great starting place for students who have not used Python at all.  They start out with writing your first lines of code and take you to the point where you can import short fragments of text to learn about strings.  With those foundations, you should be ready for this module. If you haven't done those modules yet, then we recommend starting there first.
