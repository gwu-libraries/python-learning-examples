Launch the interactive version of the Webscraper project using Binder. Binder is a free tool for hosting interactive Jupyter Notebooks and it is a great way for students to get started with learning Python.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gwu-libraries/python-learning-examples/master?filepath=social-network-analysis-actors%2Fsocial-network-analysis-actors-v2.ipynb)


After Binder launches, you should see a Jupyter Notebook file for this module.

Depending on demand, Binder can be a bit slow. But it's free!

# Python Foundations
This use of Juptyer Notebooks is based on Prof. Barba's course [Getting Data Off the Ground with Python](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:GW+EngComp1+2018/about).  And her [introductory modules (especialy 1 thru 3)](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp1_offtheground/tree/master/notebooks_en) are a great starting place for students who have not used Python at all.  They start out with writing your first lines of code and take you to the point where you can import short fragments of text to learn about strings.  With those foundations, you should be ready for this module. If you haven't done those modules yet, then we recommend starting there first.
